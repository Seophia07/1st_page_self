   TVXQ</a>,also known as Tohoshinki,made their debut
   on 26th December 2003 as a 5-member boy group.<br>
  Their debut track "Hug" showcased the membersâ€™ innocence
  as they were only teenagers back then.<br></p>
<p>TVXQ rose to international prominence in the late 2000s, after the group released
  best-selling albums<br> "O"-Jung.Ban.Hap(2006) and Mirotic (2008), both winning the Golden Disk Award
  for Album of the Year.<br> The latter album also contains the pop hit "Mirotic",
  touted by international music critics as a staple song <br>of K-pop.
  With four chart-topping singles, TVXQ gained widespread media attention in Japan
  following <br>the release of their fourth Japanese album The Secret Code (2009).</p>
  <p>However, despite their commercial success, the group plunged into legal turmoil and internal
  conflict<br> when members Jaejoong, Yoochun, and Junsu attempted to split from their Korean
  agency S.M. Enter.</p>
