  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2PM"
  target="_blank">2PM</a> is a South Korean boy band formed by JYP Entertainment.
   The group is composed of <br> six members: Jun. K, Nichkhun, Taecyeon, Wooyoung, Junho and Chansung.
   <br>Originally a seven-members in group, former member Jaebeom left the group in 2009 due to
   <br>controversies that stemmed from his posts on MySpace.</p>

   <p>Through the documentary series Hot Blood Men, Korean musician Park Jin-young formed<br>
     an eleven-member band known as One Day.<br> Finally, the band was split into
     the hip hop group 2PM and a similar but independent group 2AM.<br>
     2PM debuted with the song "10 Out of 10"("10 Points Out of 10 Points"), which showcased
     their<br> acrobatic dance styles. They then achieved their first number 1 single with "Again & Again".</p>
     <p>Both singles were featured on their first studio album, 01:59PM, which was released in 2009.
      <br>The band went on to release another Korean album, Hands Up, in 2011.<br>
      And they made their Japanese debut later that year too.</p>
