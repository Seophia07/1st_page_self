  target="_blank">Girls Generation</a>, also known as SNSD,
  debuted as a 9-member group with the track<br> Into The New World(2007).
  The group was known for their pretty visuals and set a high<br> standard
  of beauty for female idols back in the late 2000s and after.</p>
<p> Girls’ Generation shot to fame through their hit single Gee (2009),
which claimed <br>the top spot on KBS’s Music Bank for 9 consecutive weeks.
The group’s popularity <br>continued to rise with subsequent releases,
such as Tell Me Your Wish(2009), Oh!(2010),<br> Run Devil Run(2010),
and Hoot(2010) – all of which have Japanese versions too.
