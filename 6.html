  which was active<br> between 2009 and 2016. The group was composed of four members:
  Bom, CL, Dara, and Minzy.<br> Known for breaking typical stereotypes of K-pop,
  musical experimentation, fashion, and stage presence,<br> they are recognized
  for expanding girl group styles in the Korean music industry <br>and have become
  one of the leading figures of the Korean wave.</p>
<p>The group was introduced in March 2009 after appearing on the promotional
  single "Lollipop"<br> alongside labelmate Big Bang. 2NE1 rose to prominence
  with the release of their debut<br> extended play 2NE1 (2009), which featured the singles
  "Fire" and "I Don't Care". <br>The latter was named the Mnet Asian Music Award for
  Song of the Year, <br>making them receive a grand prize in the same year of debut.</p>
