  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kara_(South_Korean_group)"
  target="_blank">Kara</a>, was a Korean pop girl group formed by DSP Media in 2007.
  The group's final lineup<br> was composed of Gyuri, Seungyeon, Hara and Youngji.
  Members Nicole and Jiyoung officially <br>departed from the group in 2014, while Sunghee
  left in 2008.</p>
  <p>The group originally started off as a quartet and made their debut in March 2007
    <br>with their first studio album "The First Blooming" and its single "Break It"
    <br>while displaying a strong female image and a mature R&B sound.</p>
  <p>However, their debut was not well received by the public and was a commercial failure.
    <br>And The following year, Sunghee departed the group, and members Hara and Jiyoung<br>
    were brought in. After their addition, the group also changed their musical style and
    their<br> image to the "pretty but natural", releasing their first mini-album, Rock U
    in July 2008.<br> They achieved their first number one song with "Honey"(2009).
    Finally July 2009, they released<br> their second studio album, hit single "Mister",
    whose choreography featured the "butt-dance", <br>that helped increase the group's popularity
    within East Asia.</p>
