  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinee"
  target="_blank">SHINee</a> is a South Korean boy band formed by SM Entertainment in 2008.
  <br>The group's musical impact in their native country has earned them numerous accolades
  <br>and the title "Princes of K-pop". The group currently is composed of four members:
  <br>Onew, Key, Minho, and Taemin. <br>
  Originally a five-piece group, vocalist Jonghyun died in December 2017.</p>
  <p>The group debuted in May 2008 with their first EP, Replay, on SBS' Inkigayo with<br>
    their single "Replay". The group gained attention for starting a fashion trend
    amongst<br>students, which the media dubbed the "Shinee Trend".
    In August 2008, the group released<br> their first Korean studio
    album, The Shinee World, which won Newcomer Album of the Year<br> at the 23rd Golden
    Disc Awards. Shinee further consolidated their popularity on the South Korean<br>
    music scene with follow-up singles "Ring Ding Dong" and "Lucifer".
